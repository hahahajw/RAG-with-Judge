    "接下来的问题就是如何使用这个混合嵌入的实例进行单稀疏搜索、单密集搜索、混合搜索了\n",
    "\n",
    "具体来说有下面几种方式：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ~~在混合搜索时使用 [weight ranker（链接下方的「对候选数据重新排名」部分的内容）](https://milvus.io/docs/zh/milvus_hybrid_search_retriever.md#Define-multiple-arbitrary-vector-fields)，通过 weights 参数设置为 [1, 0]、[0, 1] 可以分别实现单密集搜索、单稀疏搜索~~\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~~不过这中方法的缺点是，没有办法获得各自的分数（距离）~~\n",
    "\n",
    "    通过控制 weighted reranker 的 weights 参数分别为 [1, 0]、[0, 1]，来实现单密集搜索、单稀疏搜索的思路是没问题的\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~~但是由于 langchain_milvus 的实现问题，即使传入了正确的 weights 参数，结果也不会像预期那样，和密集嵌入向量数据库的结果一致。你可以在下面的代码中观察到这一现象~~\n",
    "\n",
    "    这是由于我自己的失误，similarity_search_with_score 需要的是 `ranker_params`，我给写成了 `ranker_parmas`！！！\n",
    "\n",
    "    但是，当仿照方法3，绕过 langchain_milvus 封装好的 `similarity_search_with_score` 函数，直接使用 [client.hybrid_search](https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.5.x/ORM/Collection/hybrid_search.md) 函数，使用 weighted reranker 并传入正确的 weights 参数，结果就会和密集嵌入向量数据库的结果一致（自然，这里和方法3一样，也需要去除 client.fileds 中的 'sparse' 变量并在之后解析 hybrid_search 的返回结果）\n",
    "\n",
    "    有关 client.hybrid_search 的使用方法，可以参考 langchain_milvus 的实现和 [这篇](https://milvus.io/docs/zh/multi-vector-search.md#Perform-Hybrid-Search) 和 [这篇](https://milvus.io/docs/zh/hybrid_search_with_milvus.md#Hybrid-Search-with-Milvus) 文档\n",
    "\n",
    "    当然，你可以按照上面的想法，直接使用 client.hybrid_search 来实现混合检索，那样不是更复杂些。不过这样你可以控制自己仅在一些向量场上进行搜索和重排\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 还可以通过在加载混合嵌入向量数据库实例时，不向其传递对应的嵌入函数来实现。具体来说：\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. 将 `embedding_function` 或  `builtin_function` 分别设置为 None，对应着 单密集检索 或 单稀疏检索\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. 并将 `vector_filed` 设置为对应的值（`dense` 或 `sparse`）\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. 之后可以通过 langchain_milvus 封装好的 `similarity_search_with_score` 方法进行搜索，并分别获得各自的分数（距离）\n",
    "\n",
    "    这种方法可行的原因是，在 langchain_milvus 有关 `similarity_search_with_score` 的实现中，会通过判断当前 Milvus 实例中是否包含 `embedding_function` 或  `builtin_function` 来决定是使用\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. 单稀疏检索（当前实例的 `embedding_function` 为 None）\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. 单密集检索（当前实例的 `builtin_function` 为 None）\n",
    "\n",
    "        单稀疏检索和单密集检索之后都会调用 langchain_milvus 封装的 `_collection_search` 函数，该函数会使用 Milvus 中的 [search](https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.5.x/ORM/Collection/search.md) 方法\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. 混合检索（当前实例两种嵌入函数都存在）\n",
    "\n",
    "        混合检索之后会调用 langchain_milvus 封装的 `_collection_hybrid_search` 函数，该函数会使用 Milvus 中的 [hybrid_search](https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.5.x/ORM/Collection/hybrid_search.md) 方法\n",
    "    \n",
    "    该方法还需要注意的一点是：在单密集检索的情况下，需要将 Milvus 实例的 fileds 属性中的 `sparse` 变量从 list 中给 remove 掉，否则会报错 `RPC error: [search], <MilvusException: (code=65535, message=not allowed to retrieve raw data of field sparse)>`\n",
    "\n",
    "    该错误的一个解决方法是：向 `similarity_search_with_score` 函数中添加一个 `output_fileds` 参数，该参数的值为 `vs_hy_500.fileds[:].remove('sparse)`，但是由于 langchain_milvus 封装的原因，当试图向该函数传递 `output_fileds` 参数时，会提示[类似](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/18580)这样的错误\n",
    "\n",
    "    因此，只能选择「将 Milvus 实例的 fileds 属性中的 `sparse` 变量从 list 中给 remove 掉」这个方法，才能使得方法 2 在单密集检索的情况下正常\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 最后，比较好的方法是「绕过 langchain_milvus 实现的 `similarity_search_with_score`，直接使用 Milvus 提供的 `search` 函数来实现单稀疏检索、单密集检索」，可以参考 [search 方法](https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.5.x/ORM/Collection/search.md) 和 langchain_milvus 中的 `_collection_search` 函数的实现\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~~通过 client.search 函数，我们就可以在进行单稀疏检索或单密集搜索时，都需向其中的 `output_fileds` 参数传递 remove 掉 `sparse` 变量的 `vs_hy_500.fileds`，从而避免方法 2 在单密集检索时出现的错误~~\n",

    "    在使用方法 3 时，如果是在密集嵌入上进行搜索，则不必 remove `sparse` 变量。但是，当在稀疏嵌入上进行搜索时，则必须 remove `sparse` 变量，这是因为，Milvus 规定 [BM25 函数生成的稀疏向量不能在全文检索中直接访问或输出](https://milvus.io/docs/zh/full-text-search.md#FAQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "    之后还需要通过 langchain_milvus 封装的 `_parse_documents_from_search_results` 函数解析返回的搜索结果，以获得对应的文档和分数（距离）\n",

    "    此外，对于混合检索，可以继续使用 langchain_milvus 封装的 `similarity_search_with_score` 方法\n",

    "\n",
    "    这也就导致了在「存在相同实体的向量数据库」中，返回的结果和你所请求的 top_k 可能不一致\n",
    "\n",
    "    Github 中有人遇到了[类似的情况](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/discussions/39632#discussioncomment-12068026)，其原因就是因为 Milvus 实例中包含相同的实体（不过这个问题是两个实体仅包含相同的主键 `id`，你的情况是两个实体间完全相同。不过，至少可以从这个问题中明确，Milvus 的 `insert` 接口不会检查用户要存入的数据是否已存在数据库实例中。Milvus 中判断两个实体是否相同的方式是验证「主键」是否相同，默认情况下，主键是 `pk` 字段）\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 在通过 [delete](https://milvus.io/docs/zh/v2.5.x/delete-entities.md) 删除实体时，是会将所有符合条件的实体都删除的\n",

    "    比如，如果存在两个相同的实体，其 pk 都为 '1'，那么当应用 `dense_vs.delete(expr='pk==\"1\"')` 时，会将两个相同的实体都删除。即使返回结果中说「只删除了一个实体」"

    "\n",
    "1. 当请求的 top_k 过大时（大于6）时，similarity_search_with_score 方法返回的结果数量总是为 5 或 6，并不满足请求的 top_k\n",
    "\n",
    "    原因是由于 langchain_milvus 的集成问题，当经过调试后，发现：当向 similarity_search_with_score 方法「传递 `fetch_k` 参数，具体值和你所请求的 top_k 一致」时，函数就可以返回正确数量的结果\n",
    "\n",
    "    原因应当是传递过过程中的误用，在调试过程中发现一些函数使用 k，一些则传递了 fetch_k。我不能确定，但大概率是因为此\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ~~发现在混合搜索时，分别将 weighted reranker 中的 weights 参数设置为 [1, 0]、[0, 1]，分别对应着 单密集检索、单稀疏检索~~\n",
    "\n",
    "    在实体数量较大的向量数据库中没问题，但是当向量数据库中实体数量较少时，langchain_milvus 无法正确处理 weighted reranker 中的 weights 参数，返回的结果完全和 单密集检索得到的结果不一样。这一点你可以在上一个讨论的代码中观察到\n",
    "\n",
    "    之所以肯定是 langchain_milvus 的原因，是因为当绕过 langchain_milvus 封装的 similarity_search_with_score 方法，直接使用 client.hybrid_search 进行检索时，返回的结果和单密集检索的结果完全一致\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 得到的「仅包含密集检索的向量数据库」和「包含混合嵌入的向量数据库」在进行单密集检索时得到的结果并不完全一样\n",
    "\n",
    "    出现这个现象的原因，大概率是 Milvus 底层的问题。因为在上面讨论中，我使用相同的方式创建了包含不同嵌入的向量数据库，并向其中添加相同的实体，并没有复现出相同的问题\n",

    "    大概率和创建向量数据库的方式无关，因为得分较小的文档在混合嵌入向量数据库中是存在的，只不过没有被检索出来\n",
